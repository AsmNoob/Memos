Intro

Nginx is a lightweight, high performance web server designed to deliver large amounts of static content quickly with efficient use of system resources. Nginxâ€™s strong point is its ability to efficiently serve static content, like plain HTML and media files. Some consider it a less than ideal server for dynamic content.

All Nginx configuration files are located in the **/etc/nginx/** directory. The primary configuration file is **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.**
