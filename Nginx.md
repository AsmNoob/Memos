Intro
=====

Nginx is a lightweight, high performance web server designed to deliver large amounts of static content quickly with efficient use of system resources. Nginxâ€™s strong point is its ability to efficiently serve static content, like plain HTML and media files. Some consider it a less than ideal server for dynamic content.

All Nginx configuration files are located in the **/etc/nginx/** directory. The primary configuration file is **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf.**

Prerequisites
-------------

- **Install the Nginx server**

		sudo apt-get install nginx

- **Run the server**

		sudo service nginx start

- **Testing it** [YourIPAddress](http://whatismyipaddress.com/)

		Point your browser to your IP address, it should confirm that nginx was successfully installed

- **Check your VPS's IP address**
	
		ifconfig eth0 | grep inet | awk '{ print $2 }'

- **Open up the default virtual host file with this command**

		sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Preserve a Working Configuration
--------------------------------
For a really good restoration option, it's recommended making regular backups of the Nginx configuration, how ... ?

	Store the entire /etc/nginx/ directory in a Git repository

Introduction to Nginx Syntax
----------------------------

Taking an excerpts of a nginx.conf file, to analyse the different elements:
	
File excerpt: **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf**:

	user www-data;
	worker_processes 4;
	pid /run/nginx.pid;

	events {
	        worker_connections 768;
	        # multi_accept on;
	}

- **&** or **#** are comments balises
- **Settings syntax**: $variable $arguments (separated by spaces), don't forget the coma's.s
- Some settings have arguments that are themselves settings with arguments, we use the  **{ }** to deal with those.

Understanding Nginx Functioning(Nginx.config)
---------------------------------------------

###Core Directives of Nginx###

	user www-data;
	worker_processes 4;
	pid /run/nginx.pid;

	events {
	        worker_connections 768;
	        # multi_accept on;
	}

**user**:

Defines which Linux system user will own and run the Nginx server.

**worker_process**:

Defines how many threads, or simultaneous instances, of Nginx to run.

**pid**:

Defines where Nginx will write its master process ID, or PID. The PID is used by the operating system to keep track of and send signals to the Nginx process.

####Handeling webtraffic####

File excerpt: **/etc/nginx/nginx.conf**

	http {

	    ##
	    # Basic Settings
	    ##

	    sendfile on;
	    tcp_nopush on;
	    tcp_nodelay on;
	    keepalive_timeout 65;
	    types_hash_max_size 2048;
	    # server_tokens off;

	    # server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
	    # server_name_in_redirect off;

	    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
	    default_type application/octet-stream;

	    ##
	    # Logging Settings
	    ##

	    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
	    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;

	    ##
	    # Gzip Settings
	    ##

	    gzip on;
	    gzip_disable "msie6";
